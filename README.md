# MTGArtists
Python script and R commands used to pull out select information, scrub redundancies, and plot information about Magic the Gathering card artists.

The <a href="http://mtgjson.com">MTGJSON</a> database contains essentailly all relevant information about every Magic the Gathering card printed up through Modern Masters 2015.  The CardParse script was written to pull the card name, color/type (e.g. Land, Red, Colorless, etc.) artist, set, and print date from this database.  The information was used to deterime the most prolific card artists, and any color/type tendencies in their commissions.
